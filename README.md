# Parallel-Programming-Project-Universal-Decision-Tree-Classifier
A universal decision tree classifier for most datasets in UCI

Each branch stands for a parallel programming model.
If the name of branch consists of "single", means that we only construct one decision instead of a random forest.

# How to run?
If you are using a UNIX-like system, you can run our code simply by running "build.sh" file with all the source code under the same directory.
